Credit Risk Modeling in a Big-Data Setting

Apply machine learning and logistic regression to credit decisioning in a big-data setting (~900K cases).

## Transparent Models

1. Logistic Regression (follows standard theory)

2. Classification Tree (kept small for interpretability, arbitrary variables on top splits)

## Machine Learning

3. Gradient Boosting (performs best here)

4. Neural Network
