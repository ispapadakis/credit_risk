Credit Risk Modeling in a Big-Data Setting

Apply machine learning and logistic regression to credit decisioning in a big-data setting (~900K cases).

## Transparent Models

1. [Logistic Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/yanpapadakis/credit-default-risk-standardmodel) (follows standard theory)

2. [Classification Tree](https://www.kaggle.com/yanpapadakis/credit-risk-model-dtree) (kept small for interpretability, arbitrary variables on top splits)

## Machine Learning

3. [Gradient Boosting](https://www.kaggle.com/yanpapadakis/credit-risk-model-gbm) (performs best here)

4. [Neural Network](https://www.kaggle.com/yanpapadakis/credit-risk-model-nnet)
